## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Clean and analyze a real-world road traffic accident dataset
- **Platform**: Kaggle Notebooks
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, SQLite, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ ETL Breakdown

### 🧪 Extract:
- Loaded CSV files from Kaggle dataset: [Road Traffic Accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents)

### 🧹 Transform:
- Identified and handled missing values
- Standardized categorical columns
- Created a cleaned version of the dataset

### 🗃️ Load:
- Loaded cleaned data into an in-memory SQLite database
- Ran SQL queries for exploration
